# LeetCode Solutions!

I've been competitive programming since Grade 10, and unlike other sites, one of the highlights in problem-solving that I can tangibly display is my LeetCode work.

My profile can be found here: https://leetcode.com/sa35577/. I primarily use C++, but other languages I am proficient with LeetCoding are Java, Python, and JS/TS. I will be open to trying new languages in the future, because as a friend once told me, "the easiest way to learn how to solve problems in a new language, is to solve problems in that language".

Currently, I have over **400** problems solved! Feel free to take a look (under the solutions directory), and reach out to me if you want to know something more about a specific problem. Please refrain from straight copying off of the solutions. :)

Have fun with your own LeetCode journeys! - Sat

The extraction of solutions is ran with a GitHub action, every week by default unless I choose to run the action in a given period of time. It was implemented in this repository: https://github.com/joshcai/leetcode-sync, and I do not take credit for it.
